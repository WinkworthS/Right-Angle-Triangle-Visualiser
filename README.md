# Right-Angled-Triangle-Visualiser
Visualiser for right-angle triangles.

Using the centre of the window as a reference point and the current position of the mouse, data about the triangle will be calculated and displayed on the interface. The data includes: the width, the height, the length of the hypotenuse & the angle between the horizontal side and hypotenuse.

I have coloured the different parts, to show it more clearly.
